Copy the <tt>ocadia</tt> folder to your Mephisto installation's <tt>themes/site-1</tt> directory.
You'll also need to add the following line to <tt>environment.rb</tt>:

  ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Time::Conversions::DATE_FORMATS[:mdy_num] = '%m.%d.%y'


== License

The original Ocadia theme was released under the GPL license. Ocadia for Mephisto is therefore also
