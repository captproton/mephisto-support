Mephisto article image fetchy plugin
====================================

Automatically finds all external image links in an article and downloads them, 
converting to a mephisto Asset.  For example, if you write an article like

  This is an article with an <img src="http://external-site.com/image.jpg" /> image in it!
  
After saving, the article will look like

  This is an article with an <img src="/assets/2006/12/26/image.jpg" /> image in it!

This means that you no longer have to play the download-and-create-an-asset-upload game
in order to steal other people's images for your blog.
